-Hello, I’m @neon-protocol!

Currently, I'm doggedly learning python-- and just how coding in general works. 
I'm also studying for a few different COMPTIA certifications.

Looking for as many tips and pieces of advice that I can get, and hopefully I'll be able to commit a few changes of my own some day. :)

Feel free to email me here: neonprotocol9@protonmail.com
